# Assignment 1: Logistic Regression on the Titanic Dataset

## Project Description

This repository contains a Python project for building and evaluating a **Logistic Regression** model. The model is trained on the classic **Titanic dataset** to predict whether a passenger survived or not. This assignment demonstrates key machine learning concepts, including data preprocessing, model training, and performance evaluation.

## Key Concepts Covered

* **Binary Classification:** A supervised learning task with two possible outcomes.
* **Logistic Regression:** A linear model used for binary classification.
* **Data Preprocessing:** Handling missing values and converting categorical data.
* **Feature Scaling:** Standardizing features to improve model performance.
* **Model Evaluation:** Using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, confusion matrix, and the ROC curve with AUC.

## Repository Contents

* `logistic_regression.py`: The Python script containing all the code for the project.
* `Titanic-Dataset.csv`: The Titanic dataset used for training and testing the model.
* `README.md`: This file, providing an overview and instructions.

## Dependencies

You need to have the following Python libraries installed. You can install them using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn
